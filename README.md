# Taxify
Taxify is a simple taxi system using console to output data

Taxify contains 3 files: main.py which is uses LoginSystem and taxi_system and their classes to run the program. 

## Menu
Opening menu is simple: Main menu wherein user can register/ login; Options wherein userr can see all signed up users and clear data by typing the right security code (which is 91322), if user decides to do so, all users from 'users1.txt' will be removed as so as all wallets files; or to simple Exit the program.

## Registration
One of the LoginSystem's functions is to register new user - it saves user's new login and its password to 'users1.txt' (username, hashed password, date and time of register). While beeing registered, a new txt file is being created - user's wallet ({username}_wallet.txt) which contains user's available funds. Every user has its own wallet. Also, while typing in a password, its letters/ numbers are replaced with '*' for security reasons. 

## Login 
When new user has been registered, they can already sign in. The system is going to aquire to type the username and password (also covered by '*'). When user press 'enter' to login, the system will check if the username is located in 'users1.txt' (same with hashed password). If so, the program will load main menu; if the username is not found in 'users1.txt' - the program will give user few options: to create new acc/ to try again/ to go back to menu.
